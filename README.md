To Clone:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DinaSalama2004/Building-Inverted-Index-IR-Assignment-1.git
  ```

## Overview

This project builds an Inverted Index to efficiently search for text files containing specific keywords. The system processes a set of text files, indexes their contents, and handles search queries by returning files that contain all the given keywords.

### Features

- âœ… **Indexing** â€“ Parses multiple text files and builds an inverted index.
- âœ… **Efficient Searching** â€“ Returns files that contain all queried keywords.
- âœ… **Optimized Intersect Method** â€“ Implements an efficient posting list intersection.
- âœ… **Formatted Output** â€“ Cleans up posting list output for readability.
- âœ… **Well-Documented Code** â€“ Includes method comments for clarity.



### Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

- Basic knowledge of data structures (HashMaps, Lists)

#### How It Works

- Build the Index: Reads multiple text files and constructs an inverted index.

- Search for Keywords: Accepts a query with multiple keywords and finds files that contain all of them.

- Efficient Intersection: Uses optimized methods to retrieve results quickly.

### Tasks to Complete

ðŸ”¹ Implement intersect method in index5.java <br>
ðŸ”¹ Complete buildIndex method in index5.java<br>
ðŸ”¹ Implement main function in Test.java<br>
ðŸ”¹ Fix posting list formatting<br>
ðŸ”¹ Add comments to all methods<br>
