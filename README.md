Inverted Index-Based Search Engine

Overview

This project builds an Inverted Index to efficiently search for text files containing specific keywords. The system processes a set of text files, indexes their contents, and handles search queries by returning files that contain all the given keywords.

Features

âœ… Index Construction â€“ Parses text files and builds an inverted index.
âœ… Efficient Searching â€“ Returns files that contain all queried keywords.
âœ… Optimized Intersect Method â€“ Implements an efficient posting list intersection.
âœ… Formatted Output â€“ Cleans up posting list output for readability.
âœ… Well-Documented Code â€“ Includes method comments for clarity.


Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK)

Basic knowledge of data structures (HashMaps, Lists)

How It Works

Build the Index: Reads multiple text files and constructs an inverted index.

Search for Keywords: Accepts a query with multiple keywords and finds files that contain all of them.

Efficient Intersection: Uses optimized methods to retrieve results quickly.
